# Kode-Hub

**Kode Hub** is maintained by our amazing kode team: [nicoleSosa](https://github.com/nicoleSosa),  [estelacruz](https://github.com/estelacruz), and [Bernice Wu](https://github.com/Bernice55231). 

Kode Hub is a web extension explicitly designed for Computer Science students. KodeHub was created to eliminate the overwhelming feeling of having multiple tabs open by keeping them hidden in our extension. With Kode Hub, students can optimize their organization by allowing them to access all their essential computer science and class-related links in one place quickly. 

Currently Kode Hub offers the following features:

- Provides quick access to four tabs which are linked to four essential websites (Leetcode, BrightSpace, GitHub, and a course website)
- Provides an aesthetically pleasing and easy-to-use interface
