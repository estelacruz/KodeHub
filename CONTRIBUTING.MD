## How to Contribute

To contribute to **Kode Hub**:

1. **Report an issue** - you can go to our [issues page](https://github.com/ossd-s23/KodeHub/issues) and report an issue. 

   **Note:** You cannot work on your own reported issue. Allow others to work on your issues to promote collaboration in the Kode Kommunity üòÉ. 

2. **Work on an issue** - You can go to our [issues page](https://github.com/ossd-s23/KodeHub/issues), choose an issue you want to work on, and please claim it. Please wait for approval confirmation from our team. Then you can fix the issue on your forked repository of our project and send a pull request that includes the issue number. Including the issue number allows our team to track the issue easily. Lastly, our team will review and accept your pull request or ask for further clarification. 

   **Note:** If you don't claim an issue, someone else may also work on the same issue at the same time and sadly we will only accept one contribution to fix this issue. 

## Types of Contributions

- **Fixing a bug** - you can check out our [issues](https://github.com/ossd-s23/KodeHub/issues) page or find your own bugs üêõ.
- **Enchance the extension** - you can propose a new feature to improve usability.

- **Update existing examples or provide a new example**- you may find that some examples in our documentation may be outdated. We are busy people and may not notice a new software update üòû. 

## Code Style

Since our project is mainly coded in **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, we would appreciate that you stay consistent with the standard nomenclature for these languanges. Moreover, we highly encourage that you document your code such as add comments because this will ensure that other contributors can easily understand and work with your contribution.
